# Portfolio Website with React.JS ‚öõÔ∏è

## Background

I have always enjoyed design and in the past few months, I have learned web development online. 

Although I already have a portfolio wesbite on wix, it is not fully customizable. By learning software development, I have greater control on the design of my portfolio website. 

Hence, I would like to create react website from scratch to apply my coding and design skill. 


## Objective 
- To apply design thinking in portfolio design 
- To apply web development best practices to code portfolio website from scratch
- To deploy web development online on Netlify 


## Project Timeline 

- Weekend (13 Oct - 30 Oct 2022)
